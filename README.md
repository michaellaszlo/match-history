**Web display of Elo ratings and other player statistics for any sport with two-player matches**

Given a record of matches in some sport, this package produces a comparative display of any two players' histories. It
displays the Elo rating of each player and the competitive history that the players have in common. Two degrees of
separation will be shown.

* first degree: player A's matches against player B
* second degree: for each player C who has played against A and B, A's matches with C and B's matches with C

Users will be able to click on any player to go further into the competition graph.
